### VoiceOfCity
-------------

![Texto alternativo](logo.jpg)

This is a mod to interact with peds in game using Generative AI. 
The NPCs are aware of the current weather, time, location, and their own skin attributes, which are used to assign a personality based on their appearance. They can remember conversations (until they disappear due to game limitations), support voice audio generation, and perform actions based on the conversation â€” such as deciding to leav, attack the player or even follow it.
